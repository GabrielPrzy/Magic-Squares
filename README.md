# Magic Squares
An algorithm that generate symmetric and random magic squares using Python lambda.

### This repository contains
- The implementation of the **algorithm** with python lambda and interface with pygame
- The **main program**, that can be runned on pycharm with the installation of pygame
- A detailed **article** that explains the functionality of the algorithm and the process of built a symmetrical square.

### Whats is a magic square?
*A magic square is a square that is completely **symmetrical**. The sum of any column generates a **constant number**, that is simultaneously the sum of any line or diagonal of this square.*

### Why?
*Magic square* is a very old mathematical concept, and also a topic of *Number Theory*. For mathematical and computational purposes is an interesting challenge, given the complexity of a symmectrical matriz and the conditions to built a magic square.
