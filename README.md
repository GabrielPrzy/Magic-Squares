# Magic Squares
An algorithm that generate symmetric and random 10x10 magic squares using Python lambda.

### This repository contains
- The implementation of the **algorithm** with python lambda and interface with pygame
- The **main program**, that can be runned on pycharm with the installation of pygame
- An detailed **article** that explains the functionality of the algorithm and the process of built an symmetrical square.

### Whats is a magic square?
*A magic square is a square that is completely **symmetrical**. The sum of any column generates a **constant number**, that is simultaneously the sum of any line or diagonal of this square.*
